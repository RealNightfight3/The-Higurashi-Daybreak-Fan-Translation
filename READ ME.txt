 2.   You need a copy of the game. It should be noted that this game can be
      hard to obtain due to the fact that the manufacturer has stopped 
      producing it. Given that, you can often find this game on many
      search engines The original game is around 2.4GB and the expansion is 
      around 1.68GB. This should only be done as a last resort if you cannot
      find the game anywhere else. PLEASE TRY TO OBTAIN IT LEGITLY!

      says "daybreak". 

 4.   In the "Patch list" section, check off "Dialogue_ENG". 
      Then click "Apply Patch".

 5.   Then a pop up will ask "Write to daybreak0x.dat OK?". Click "OK" in that window.     
      The "Info" tab will then say "finish" when done. 
     
 7.   Open the game either by clicking the icon in the launcher or in the folder.

 8.   Your game is now in English! Enjoy :D
